## Information for CI

By default only the master branch of the main repository runs the gitlab CI workflow. 

If you want to run the gitlab CI workflow in your private fork, you need to create some variables to set up your voms-proxy. You can follow (https://awesome-workshop.github.io/gitlab-cms/03-vomsproxy/index.html)[these steps] (except the last part, Using the grid proxy).
