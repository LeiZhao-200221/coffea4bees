# Python code

This is a [coffea](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/index.html) based analysis. To run the content of this folder one must set the cointainer using singularity described in [here](../README.md). 

_All the code in this folder assumes that this is the root folder, i.e. all the references are based from this directory._

Here the folders contain:
 - [classifier](./classifier/): __add info__
 - [data](./data/): correction files
 - [base_class](./base_class/): common files for plotting, corrections, etc.
 - [skimmer](./skimmer/): __add info__
 - [analysis](./analysis/): analysis processor to create histograms with selection and files to make plots
 -
More information about each process in the README.md of each folder.
