**Use when:** You need command-line tools, automation scripts, utilities to fix common problems, or memory monitoring to prevent system crashes.

### 🧰 Utilities (`utils/`)
Generic, reusable utilities that don't fit into specific domains.

- Argument parsing helpers
- JSON encoding/decoding
- String manipulation
- Retry mechanisms
- Generic wrapper functions

**Use when:** You need generic helper functions, argument parsing, or common utility operations.

### 🧪 Tests (`tests/`)
Test suite mirroring the package structure.

- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests
- Test utilities and fixtures

## Design Principles

### 1. **Domain-Driven Organization**
Each directory represents a clear conceptual domain that users can easily understand and discover.

### 2. **Dependency Direction**
Dependencies generally flow "upward" in this order:
```
utils → (storage, data_formats, math) → (hist, physics, dask) → (plotting, skimmer) → scripts
```

### 3. **User-Centric Naming**
Directory names reflect what users are trying to accomplish, not technical implementation details.

### 4. **Independent Base Components**
Components in this library should be independent of higher-level analysis code and reusable across different physics analyses.

## Migration from Previous Structure

### Import Path Changes
The following import paths have changed for better organization:

| Old Import Path | New Import Path | Deprecation Shim |
|---|---|---|
| `base_class.awkward` | `base_class.data_formats.awkward` | ✅ Available |
| `base_class.numpy` | `base_class.data_formats.numpy` | ✅ Available |
| `base_class.root` | `base_class.data_formats.root` | ✅ Available |
| `base_class.system` | `base_class.storage` | ✅ Available |
| `base_class.plots` | `base_class.plotting` | ✅ Available |

### Backward Compatibility
Deprecation shims are provided for all moved modules. Old import paths will continue to work but will issue `DeprecationWarning`s. Update your imports to the new paths to remove warnings.

## Common Usage Patterns

### Reading ROOT Files
```python
from src.data_formats.root import TreeReader, Friend
from src.storage import EOS

# Read from EOS
reader = TreeReader(EOS("root://path/to/file.root"))
data = reader.read()

# Work with friend trees
friend = Friend(reader, "friend_name")
```

### Array Format Conversion
```python
from src.data_formats.awkward import to_numpy
from src.data_formats.numpy import from_

# Convert awkward to numpy
np_data = to_numpy(ak_array)

# Convert from base64 numpy
array = from_.base64(encoded_data)
```

### Configuration Management
```python
from src.config import ConfigManager, config

# Load and manage configuration
config_mgr = ConfigManager("config.yaml")
my_setting = config("analysis.cuts.pt_min")
```

### Distributed Computing
```python
from src.dask import delayed
from src.hist import hist

# Delayed histogram computation
@delayed
def compute_histogram(data):
    return hist(data, bins=50)
```

## Physics Corrections & Analysis Data (`data/`)
Stores physics corrections, calibration files, and other analysis resources (previously in `python/data/`, now in `python/base_class/data/`).

- **`Btag/`** - b-tagging scale factors and calibration files
- **`JEC/`** - jet energy corrections and related resources
- **`Muon/`** - muon corrections and scale factors
- **`PU/`** - pileup weights and corrections
- **`goldenJSON/`** - certified JSON files for luminosity sections
- **`puId/`** - pileup identification files
- ...other physics analysis resources

**Use when:** You need physics corrections, calibration files, or certified JSONs for analysis workflows.

> **Note:** All references to these files should now use the path `base_class/data/` instead of the legacy `data/` location.

## Contributing

When adding new functionality:

1. **Choose the right domain** - Place code in the directory that matches its primary purpose
2. **Keep dependencies minimal** - Avoid circular dependencies between domains
3. **Document the purpose** - Update this README when adding new directories or major functionality
4. **Add tests** - Mirror the structure in the `tests/` directory
5. **Consider users** - Think about discoverability and intuitive organization

## Future Evolution

This structure is designed to grow with the analysis needs while maintaining clear separation of concerns. New domains can be added as needed, and existing domains can be subdivided if they become too large or complex.
